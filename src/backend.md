# Backend

Backend services are composed of different modules:

- The platform broker that performs the main configuration communication between the devices and the platform.

- The data broker that stores the data measurements generated by the devices in cloud databases.

- The alert manager that stores the events of the devices that can generate alerts, and in turn keeps an audit log.

- API Rest backoffice. Allows to work with the platform through API and through the Chestnut backoffice frontend in ReactJS.
